# movie

This project aims to answer two key questions about movies: what makes a movie profitable and what makes a movie highly rated. Using a dataset containing information on movies up to 2017, the report provides detailed data descriptions and statistical analyses using the R language. The report includes a summary of statistics for revenue, budget, profitability (ROI), rating, runtime, genres, and released year and month, as well as correlations and statistical tests for continuous and categorical variables. The findings indicate that budget and runtime significantly impact revenue, while smaller budget movies tend to receive better ratings. Positive ROI movies also tend to receive better ratings than those that do not profit. This project also notes that movies released in Q2 and Q4 have better box office results, and Q4 releases tend to receive better ratings. However, this project acknowledges limitations due to missing data and the complexity of factors that influence profitability and rating. Overall, this project provides insights into factors that may impact a movie's success but suggests that further analysis and complete data are needed to make better analysis.

We obtained the datasets titled "The Movies Dataset" by user "rounak banik" from Kaggle. The dataset contains the data of 45,466 movies released on or before July 2017, which were listed in the Full Movie Lens Dataset. The data include vote counts and vote averages from The Movie Database.
